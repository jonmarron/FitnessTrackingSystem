Fitness Tracking System:
- I want a system to track my workouts and fitness goals.
  Each user should have a unique username, a password, an email, and can have several workouts.
- Workouts should have a workout ID, a type (such as cardio or strength training), a duration in minutes and one goal.
- Goals should have a goal ID, a type (weight loss, muscle gain, muscle definition), and whether they have been completed.

- Can you create a function that retrieves all workouts of a certain type that were completed by a certain user by username?
- Can you create a function that retrieves all workouts from all users that have at least a minimum duration and haven't been completed?
